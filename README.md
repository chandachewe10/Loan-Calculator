# Loan Calculator


This is a simple Loan dynamic Calculator built with VUEJS that can be used to calculate one's total amount 
to be repaid within a given time-frame (weekly loan repayments) and how much he/she
 will be paying monthly in order to cover that loan amount.
  It can be integrated in loan management system websites.
